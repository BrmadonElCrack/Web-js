## Proyect

***My name is Bramdon, the java code is mine and the html and css code is from udacity.***
***In this project the buttons and their color are created with js.***

**To open the project there will be _"index.html"_**
I use the "active" class to change the colors of the buttons
I use the "your-active-class" class to place the circles
